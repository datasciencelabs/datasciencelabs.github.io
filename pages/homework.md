Homework assignments and solutions will be add here throughout the semester. 

**Late Policy**

10% of the total points for the homework will be deducted for every late day. Students can have a total of 4 late days without penalty during the entire semester. No need to provide a written excuse. But providing an excuse does not give you more days unless an accommodation is requested and approved by Student Affairs. Otherwise, it is a total of 4 for everybody.

If your Rmd does not knit, you will be deducted late days, and you will be notified. You need to resubmit an Rmd that does knit. You will be deducted further late days for every day it takes for you to turn in an Rmd that does knit.

Note that if you get COVID you need to request an accommodation from Student Affairs.
